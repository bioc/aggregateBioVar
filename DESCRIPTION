Description: For single cell RNA-seq data collected from more than 
    one subject (e.g. biological sample or technical replicates),
    this package contains tools to summarize single cell gene expression
    profiles at the level of subject. A SingleCellExperiment object is taken as
    input and converted to a list of SummarizedExperiment objects, where each
    list element corresponds to an assigned cell type.
    The SummarizedExperiment objects contain aggregate gene-by-subject
    count matrices and inter-subject column metadata for individual subjects
    that can be processed using downstream bulk RNA-seq tools.
